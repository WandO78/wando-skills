### Phase integration
when_to_use: |
  Invoke automatically during phase execution:
  - Level 1 (AUTO): every 5 checklist items or every commit
  - Level 2 (SMART): at --- CHECKPOINT --- markers or context 50%
  - Level 3 (EMERGENCY): at context window 80% — last line of defense
  The checkpoint system is the SAFETY NET of the entire skill library.
  Without it, all other skills' work can be lost on context reset.

## WHEN TO USE

| Trigger | Example | Auto-invoke? |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 5 checklist items done | Routine progress save | Yes — Level 1 AUTO |
| Every git commit | Post-commit save | Yes — Level 1 AUTO |
| `--- CHECKPOINT X ---` marker | Reached checkpoint line in phase file | Yes — Level 2 SMART |
| Context window ~50% | Agent notices growing context | Yes — Level 2 SMART |
| Important decision made | Architectural decision, large refactor | No — agent decides (Level 2) |
| Context window ~80% | Agent detects compression/truncation notice | Yes — Level 3 EMERGENCY |

## WHEN NOT TO USE

| Case | Why NOT | Use Instead |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Phase close | Close is more comprehensive (includes quality review + severity) | `/wando:close` |
| No active phase file | Nothing to save checkpoint against | — |
| Simple non-phase task | No checklist to track | — |

## SKILL LOGIC

> **3-level save system. Each level is a SUPERSET of the previous.**
> Level 1 ⊂ Level 2 ⊂ Level 3.
> The higher the level, the more is saved, the more it costs in time.

### Overview

```
LEVEL 1: AUTO          LEVEL 2: SMART           LEVEL 3: EMERGENCY
─────────────────      ─────────────────        ─────────────────
Trigger:               Trigger:                 Trigger:
 Every 5 items          Checkpoint marker        Context 80%
 Every commit           Context 50%
                        Important decision

Saves:                 Saves (Level 1 +):       Saves (Level 2 +):
 [x] checklist marks    Interim Phase Memory     Debug context
 >>> CURRENT <<< move   CONTEXT_CHAIN entry      Open questions
 Progress Log row       Git commit               Current task state
 Current Step update                             Git status snapshot

Cost: ~30 sec          Cost: ~1-2 min           Cost: ~2-3 min
Frequency: Often       Frequency: Planned       Frequency: Rare
```

### Step 1: Determine Checkpoint Level

The agent determines the level based on the trigger:

**Level 1 (AUTO) triggers:**
- Counter: 5 checklist items completed since last checkpoint
- Event: a git commit was just made
- This is the DEFAULT level — lightweight, frequent, no thinking required

**Level 2 (SMART) triggers:**
- The agent reaches a `--- CHECKPOINT X (description) ---` line in the phase file
- The agent notices context window is approximately 50% full
- An important architectural decision was just made
- A significant milestone was reached (e.g., all tests passing for a section)

**Level 3 (EMERGENCY) triggers:**
- The agent detects context window is approximately 80% full
- Signs: system compression notices, message truncation warnings, context getting very long
- This is the LAST LINE OF DEFENSE — if we don't save now, everything is lost

**When in doubt:** Level 2 is always safe. Over-checkpointing wastes a minute; under-checkpointing can lose hours.

**Edge case — no git repo:** If the project has no git repository, skip all git-related actions (commit, status snapshot). The file-based saves (checklist marks, Progress Log, Phase Memory, CONTEXT_CHAIN) still work and are the primary recovery mechanism.

---

### Step 2: Execute Level 1 (AUTO)

Level 1 is a fast, mechanical save. No AI summarization needed.

**2a. Update checklist marks**

Mark completed items with `[x]`:
```
- [x] **1.1** Implement user model    ← was [ ], now [x]
  - [x] 1.1.1 Zod schema             ← was [ ], now [x]
  - [x] 1.1.2 Database migration     ← was [ ], now [x]
```

**2b. Move `>>> CURRENT <<<` marker**

Move the marker to ABOVE the next pending `[ ]` item:

```
- [x] **1.2** Implement API routes

>>> CURRENT <<<

- [ ] **1.3** Write integration tests
```

**Movement rules:**
- The marker is ALWAYS above the FIRST unchecked `[ ]` item
- If all items in a section are `[x]`: move marker to the next section
- If all items are `[x]`: marker goes above `--- FINAL CHECKPOINT ---`
- There is exactly ONE `>>> CURRENT <<<` marker in the file at all times

**2c. Add Progress Log row**

Append a row to the Progress Log table in the phase file:

```
| N | YYYY-MM-DD | X.Y-X.Z | completed | [brief description of what was done] |
```

Format rules:
- `#`: sequential number
- `Date`: today's date
- `Step`: range of completed items (e.g., `1.1-1.3`)
- `Status`: one of `completed` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `skipped`
- `Notes`: 1 short sentence

**2d. Update `Current Step` metadata**

Update the header at the top of the phase file:
```
## Current Step: 1.3
```

---

### Step 3: Execute Level 2 (SMART) — extends Level 1

Do everything from Level 1 PLUS:

**3a. Fill Interim Phase Memory**

In the Phase Memory section at the bottom of the phase file, add to the "Interim Memory" subsection:

```
### Interim Memory (collected from checkpoints)
- [CP-A] The SAP API uses integer IDs, not UUIDs — conversion needed at import
- [CP-A] The report generation service should be separate from the main API
- [CP-B] React Server Components can't use useEffect — moved data fetching to server
```

What to record:
- Decisions made ("we chose X because Y")
- Lessons learned ("the API behaves differently than documented")
- Surprises ("this library doesn't support ESM")
- Patterns discovered ("all CRUD entities follow the same schema pattern")

**3b. Update CONTEXT_CHAIN.md**

Add a new entry at the TOP of the chain (below the header), following this format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Session: [Phase name] — CP-X: [brief description]

**Phase:** Phase XX — [name]
**Step:** [start] → [current]
**Status:** in_progress

### What happened
- [1-3 bullet points summarizing work since last entry]

### Next session task
- [What the next session should continue with]
```

Keep entries concise: max 15-20 lines. The Resumption Protocol reads the LAST entry.

**3c. Git commit**

Create a commit with a standardized message:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase XX — CP-X: [brief description]"
```

Commit message format:
- `Phase XX` — the phase number
- `CP-X` — the checkpoint letter (CP-A, CP-B, etc.)
- `[description]` — 1 short sentence (what was accomplished)

Example: `Phase 03 — CP-B: SAP import complete, report generation started`

**3d. Context Refresh (Compaction Defense)**

After saving, re-read fresh context to guard against compaction drift:

1. Re-read the phase file's `>>> CURRENT <<<` section — the next 3-5 checklist items
2. If working with a specific skill, re-read that SKILL.md's SKILL LOGIC section
3. State back to the conversation: "I am at step X.Y, working on [description], next is [next item]"

This ensures the agent has fresh instructions even if earlier chat context was compacted.
The re-read takes ~15 seconds but prevents hours of role drift.

> **Why here and not Level 1?** Level 1 is mechanical (mark items, move marker).
> Role drift only matters at the points where the agent needs to THINK about what to do next —
> which is exactly when Level 2 fires (section boundaries, context 50%, important decisions).

---

### Step 4: Execute Level 3 (EMERGENCY) — extends Level 2

Do everything from Level 2 PLUS:

**4a. Save debug context**

Add to the Progress Log with EMERGENCY status:

```
| N | YYYY-MM-DD | EMERGENCY | saved | Context full at step X.Y: [what was being worked on], [current state], [root cause if found] |
```

The Notes field MUST contain:
- What step/task was in progress
- What the current state of that task is (working? failing? debugging?)
- If debugging: what the suspected root cause is
- What was tried and what worked/didn't work

Example:
```
| 7 | 2026-03-01 | EMERGENCY | saved | Context full at step 2.3: AI summary endpoint test failing, root cause: missing VSGPT_API_KEY in test env, fix identified but not yet applied |
```

**4b. Save open questions**

Add to the Interim Phase Memory:

```
### Interim Memory (collected from checkpoints)
...existing entries...
- [EMERGENCY] Open questions: (1) Should the AI summary use streaming? (2) Is the 500ms timeout enough for production?
- [EMERGENCY] Current task: Fixing test env for AI summary endpoint — the VSGPT_API_KEY needs to be in .env.test
- [EMERGENCY] Uncommitted files: api/routes/ai-summary.ts, tests/ai-summary.test.ts
```

**4c. Git status snapshot**

Record the output of `git status` and `git diff --stat` in the Phase Memory:

```
- [EMERGENCY] Git status: 2 files modified (api/routes/ai-summary.ts, tests/ai-summary.test.ts), 0 untracked
```

**4d. Emergency git commit**

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase XX — EMERGENCY: context full at step X.Y — [1 sentence]"
```

**4e. Context Refresh (Critical — post-emergency)**

Same as Level 2 step 3d, but even MORE critical here:

1. Re-read the phase file's `>>> CURRENT <<<` section
2. Re-read the relevant SKILL.md's SKILL LOGIC section
3. Re-read GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES.md (if exists)
4. State back: "EMERGENCY checkpoint completed. I am at step X.Y, the task state is [state], next action is [action]"

At 80% context, compaction is imminent or already happening. This re-read is the LAST CHANCE
to anchor the agent's role before the context window resets.

**4f. CONTEXT_CHAIN emergency entry**

The CONTEXT_CHAIN entry for emergency checkpoints has an extra section:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Session: [Phase name] — EMERGENCY at step X.Y

**Phase:** Phase XX — [name]
**Step:** [start] → [current]
**Status:** emergency

### What happened
- [work summary]

### Next session task
- [EXACTLY what to do first when resuming]

### Emergency context
- **Debug state:** [what was being debugged and findings so far]
- **Uncommitted files:** [list of modified files]
- **Open questions:** [decisions still pending]
```

---

### Step 5: Post-Checkpoint Verification

After any checkpoint level, verify:

**Level 1 verification:**
- [ ] `>>> CURRENT <<<` marker is at the correct position (above first unchecked item)
- [ ] All completed items are marked `[x]`
- [ ] Progress Log has a new row
- [ ] `Current Step:` header matches the actual current item

**Level 2 verification (Level 1 +):**
- [ ] Interim Phase Memory has a new entry tagged with checkpoint letter
- [ ] CONTEXT_CHAIN.md has a new entry at the top
- [ ] Git commit exists with `Phase XX — CP-X:` format
- [ ] Context Refresh: agent re-read phase file current section and stated next step

**Level 3 verification (Level 2 +):**
- [ ] Progress Log has an EMERGENCY row with debug context
- [ ] Interim Phase Memory has `[EMERGENCY]` entries (task state, open questions, git status)
- [ ] CONTEXT_CHAIN has emergency entry with debug state + uncommitted files
- [ ] Emergency git commit exists
- [ ] Context Refresh: agent re-read phase file, SKILL.md, GOLDEN_PRINCIPLES and stated current state

---

## SKILL INTEGRATIONS

| When this happens... | Call | When |
|---------------------|------|------|
| Level 2+ needs CONTEXT_CHAIN update | `/wando:chain` | At SMART and EMERGENCY checkpoints (Step 3b, 4e) |
| FINAL CHECKPOINT reached | `/wando:close` | The last checkpoint triggers phase close |
| Z7 phase: every commit | Regression check | In Z7, run existing tests after every commit (not just checkpoints) |

---

## VERIFICATION

### Success indicators
- `>>> CURRENT <<<` marker at the correct position in the phase file
- All completed items marked `[x]` — no stale unchecked items
- Progress Log has rows for each checkpoint (including EMERGENCY rows with debug context)
- Level 2+: Interim Phase Memory filled (not empty after SMART/EMERGENCY checkpoint)
- Level 2+: CONTEXT_CHAIN.md updated with concise entry (max 15-20 lines)
- Level 3: Debug context saved (what was being worked on, root cause, open questions)
- Level 3: Uncommitted files listed in Phase Memory
- Git commits follow `Phase XX — CP-X: [description]` format (Level 2+)
- A new session can resume within 2 minutes by following the Resumption Protocol

### Failure indicators (STOP and fix!)
- `>>> CURRENT <<<` marker missing or at wrong position (will confuse next session)
- Empty Progress Log after checkpoint (no record of what happened)
- Level 2 checkpoint with empty Interim Phase Memory (lessons lost between sessions!)
- Level 3 without debug context (the most critical information to save, and it's missing)
- Level 3 without git commit (uncommitted work at risk of loss)
- CONTEXT_CHAIN entry > 30 lines (too long — the Resumption Protocol needs fast reads)
- Multiple `>>> CURRENT <<<` markers in the same file (should be exactly one)

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Level 1 AUTO — Routine save after 5 items

Agent completes items 1.1 through 1.5 in Phase 03.

**Actions:**
1. Mark items 1.1-1.5 as `[x]`
2. Move `>>> CURRENT <<<` above item 1.6
3. Add Progress Log row: `| 1 | 2026-03-02 | 1.1-1.5 | completed | User model schema, migration, and basic CRUD routes |`
4. Update `Current Step: 1.6`

**Time cost:** ~30 seconds. No git commit, no Phase Memory, no CONTEXT_CHAIN update.

### Example 2: Level 2 SMART — Checkpoint marker reached

Agent reaches `--- CHECKPOINT A (Section 1 complete) ---` in the phase file.

**Actions (Level 1 +):**
1. All Level 1 actions (checklist, marker, progress log, current step)
2. Interim Phase Memory: `[CP-A] Zod schemas should be defined BEFORE API routes — it caught 3 type mismatches early`
3. CONTEXT_CHAIN entry: `Phase 03 — CP-A: User model complete, starting API routes`
4. Git commit: `Phase 03 — CP-A: User model schema, migration, and CRUD complete`

**Time cost:** ~1-2 minutes.

### Example 3: Level 3 EMERGENCY — Context 80% full

Agent detects context compression. Currently debugging a test failure at step 2.3.

**Actions (Level 2 +):**
1. All Level 1 + Level 2 actions
2. Progress Log EMERGENCY row: `| 5 | 2026-03-02 | EMERGENCY | saved | Context full at step 2.3: dashboard query test failing, suspected cause: missing JOIN on budget_year column, fix identified but not applied |`
3. Phase Memory `[EMERGENCY]` entries:
   - `[EMERGENCY] Current task: Fix dashboard query test — need to add budget_year JOIN`
   - `[EMERGENCY] Open questions: Should we index budget_year for performance?`
   - `[EMERGENCY] Uncommitted files: backend/routes/dashboard.ts, tests/dashboard.test.ts`
4. CONTEXT_CHAIN emergency entry with debug state + uncommitted files
5. Git commit: `Phase 03 — EMERGENCY: context full at step 2.3 — dashboard query test fix in progress`

**Time cost:** ~2-3 minutes. But it SAVES the next session from starting from scratch.

### Example 4: New session resumes using checkpoint data

A new session starts. The agent follows the Resumption Protocol:

1. Reads START_HERE.md → "Phase 03 — IN PROGRESS — Step 2.3"
2. Reads CONTEXT_CHAIN.md last entry → "EMERGENCY at step 2.3, dashboard query test, missing JOIN"
3. Reads Phase 03 file:
   - `>>> CURRENT <<<` at step 2.3
   - Progress Log last row: EMERGENCY details
   - Interim Phase Memory: learned about the JOIN issue, uncommitted files listed
4. Runs `git status` → sees 2 modified files
5. Runs `git diff` → understands the in-progress changes
6. **Resumes at step 2.3** — applies the JOIN fix, runs tests → PASS → continues

**Total resumption time: ~2 minutes.** Without the checkpoint, this would take 15-30 minutes of rediscovery.
